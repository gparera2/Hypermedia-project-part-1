# Hypermedia project hand-in
## Part 1: Create your CV Website
In this project, I have designed and developed a website to show my Curriculum Vitae. This website shows my profile and also my skills and experience (as a typical CV).

### 1. User Characterization
- **End User:** Potential employers, managers, or collaborators within the programming and technology sector looking for a computer engineering profile. This may also include companies interested in my specific skills and experience in programming, web development, and management.
- **Expectations:** Users expect well-organized, detailed information on my technical skills, work experience, education, and contact information. They also look for a visual style that reflects professionalism and a demonstration of my capabilities in web design.

### 2. Information Architecture
This is a single-section page with a vertical layout that allows users to easily scroll between sections. Hereâ€™s the structure:
- **Start:** Initial section with my name and professional title. A brief, animated message highlights my focus and captures attention.
- **About Me:** A personal introduction and overview of my profile.
- **Skills:** A breakdown of technical skills with proficiency levels in tools and programming languages.
- **Career:** Academic background and work experience, detailing each stage.
- **Contact:** Contact information, including phone and email, to facilitate direct communication.

### 3. Visual Design
- **Color Palette:** The primary color chosen is blue (#2288ED), which conveys professionalism and trust, especially within a technical context. This is paired with black and gray to create contrast, giving the page a modern, clean look.
- **Typography:** The primary font, 'Courier New,' offers a coding and programming vibe, aligning with my tech-oriented profile.
- **Page Layout:** A single-column layout enhances navigation. Sections alternate between solid color backgrounds and background images to maintain an attractive and organized visual structure.
